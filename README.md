THIS IS A JOKE GAME!!!

1. for start this game download python 3.8 https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-388/ linux: https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install3/linux/

2. download pygame: start a terminal and enter "pip3 install pygame"

3. rearchive this with all files and start the main.py with "python3.8 main.py". IT IS IMPORTANT that main.py was located in the same directory as the other archive folders!!!
